A few of my favorite photographs. I started shooting 35mm film in 2017 after
purchasing a vintage Olympus OM-G camera. Most shots are taken with a Zuiko 28mm
, 50mm, 135mm, 200mm, and a 35-70mm zoom lens. I hope to get better at double
exposures, metering, and general composition. I recently have really been
enjoying macro photography.
